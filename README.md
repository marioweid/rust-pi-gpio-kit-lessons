Note: 
* Some of the Lessons require an ADC (analog digital converter), which the pi is missing.
* Also the ADC is not in the Toolkit itself, but could be bought from ali-express or whatever
* The Lesson with the multiplexer was skipped since the breadboard is so small, that i could barely fit any more wires on it
